- (Annual) THREAD of Hope


## Goal for analysis

1. Improved Fundraising Strategies

- Goal: Identify giving trends, optimal donation times, and preferred donation methods.

- Why: Better understanding of donor behavior can help tailor solicitation approaches for higher impact.

2. Enhanced Donor Retention & Engagement

- Goal: Analyze donor giving frequency, donation amounts, and engagement history.

- Why: Understanding these patterns can lead to strategies that increase long-term donor loyalty.

3. Better Decision-Making

- Use donor data to prioritize high-value donors and identify new prospect segments.

- More targeted decision-making leads to more effective fundraising efforts.

4. Better Resource Allocation
- Goal: Analyze both hospital and donor data to determine where resources can be most effectively deployed.

- Why: Ensuring that funds and efforts are allocated to programs or areas that yield the highest impact.

## Some Ideas

### 1. Donor Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

- Resource: https://npoinfo.com/donor-segmentation/#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20recency%2C%20frequency%2C%20and,based%20on%20their%20giving%20habits)

- New vs. Returning Donors

- Small, Mid, Major Donors (e.g. <$100, $100-$1000, >$1000) -> which segment contributes the most & target segments with growth potential

- Geographic Segmentation 

- Donor Profiles: build profile for key segments

+ "Loyalists" - donors with high frequency. How much do they contribute over time? What campaigns engage them? Show that retaining these loyal donors yields high cumulative value

+ "Champions" - a few major donors contributing large amounts. Cultivate more mid-level donors into major donors

+ "Occasional Supports" - Donors who give infrequently or only to specific campaigns/events -> patterns and considered targeted reminders/event-specific follow-ups

- Could do a regression model to forecast future donation amounts based on trends and donor growth

### 2. Fundraising Campaign Effectiveness

- Use `Campaign` to compare fundraising outcomes

+ Total funds raised per campaign, number of donors, and average gifts

+ Timeline of Campaigns

+ ROI of Campaign Types

- `Appeal` Channel Effectiveness

### 3. Donor Retention & Growth Modeling

- Year-over-Year Donor Retention: percentage of donors return each year

- Lifetime Value & Predictive Model: Model to predict donor lifetime value or likelihood to donate again (logistics/decision tree sounds reasonable here)

- Growth Trends: Just simple data analysis

- Churn Analysis: Identify characteristics of donors who did not return

### 4. Therapy Program Reach & Impact Analysis

- Expansion opportunities -> introducing new programs to hospitals that currently not have it, if resources allowed

- Patients served & session volumes -> scale of impact

- Therapy Modality Insights -> which activities are most commonly used + connect to outcome

- Demographic breakdown -> age, racial distribution, gender and family involvement

- Unmet needs -> number of patients who could not receive therapy due to scheduling conflicts or capacity

## Linking Funding to Impact

- Impact per Dollar: Answer question like "What does each $1 donated accomplish?"

- Donor Location vs. Hospital Location -> heat map maybe 

- Campaigns tied to programs?
